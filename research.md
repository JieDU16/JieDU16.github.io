### Research Interests

1. Numerical solutions for PDEs using:
- Finite element discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods,
- Finite difference weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) methods, 
- Correction procedure via reconstruction (CPR) methods.

2. Continuum modeling and numerical methods for traffic flow problems.

3. Computational fluid dynamics.
